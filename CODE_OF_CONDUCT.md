# Contributor Code of Conduct

For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another. For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” If, however, you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another. - [Galatians 5:13-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.5.13-Gal.5.15&version=NRSVCE)
